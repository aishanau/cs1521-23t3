# COMP1521 Tutorial

Hi Everyone,
This is where I will be uploading all content to throughout the term!

## Contents
Above you can find folders for each week. In these folders will be:
- a README.md file which:
  - includes a link to that week's lecture slides 
  - may include additional links to other resources relevant that week
- tutorial code which we write up during the lesson
- annotated pdf of the lecture slides if i draw any diagrams during the lesson


## Contact information
If you have any questions regarding the lectures, tutorials or lab exercises feel free to post on the course forum about these issues since they are better answered there.

If you have any other questions that pertain to yourself (i.e. regarding issues with submissions, deadline extensions etc.) OR any suggestions/improvements for future tutorials please email me at:
**a.nauman@unsw.edu.au**

Looking forward to this term! 

~~Aisha
